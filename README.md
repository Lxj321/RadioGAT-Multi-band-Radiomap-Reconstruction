**Code for RadioGAT
（Please ignore the commit message）**


**Program running order：**
1. Run Data_read.py
2. Run Radio_Depth_Generate.py
3. Run NodeFeature_Generate.py
4. Run Depth_Adj_Generate.py
5. Run GAT_V2025.py

If you use RadioGAT in other datasets. Please check if the hyperparameters in "Radio_Depth_Generate.py" and "Depth_Adj_Generate.py" are suitable.


**Follow-up:**
1. Add details for different programs and files.
2. Add other adjacency matrices such as adjacency-based, environment-based and transmitter-based methods.
